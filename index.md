## About Me

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Linguistics Program](https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/artsandsciences/linguistics/index.php) at the [University of South Carolina](https://sc.edu). My research explores the processing of linguistic and paralinguistic cues in the context of emotion from a cross-linguistic perspective. I am co-advised by Drs. [Jiang Liu](https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/artsandsciences/dllc/our_people/liu_jiang.php) and [Rutvik H. Desai](https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/artsandsciences/psychology/our_people/directory/desai_rutvik.php). I am currently a graduate research assistant in the [Desai Lab](https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/artsandsciences/psychology/research_clinical_facilities/labs/desai_lab/index.php/).

My dissertation investigates how native and non-native speakers perceive and process emotional information through semantics and prosody in a tonal language——Mandarin Chinese, and examines how semantics influences their perception of emotional prosody. I also utilize [functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_magnetic_resonance_imaging) to explore whether native speakers and non-native speakers use similar brain mechanisms to process semantics and emotional prosody in speech.
