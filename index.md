## About Me

I am a Ph.D. in the [Linguistics](https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/artsandsciences/linguistics/index.php) at the [University of South Carolina](https://sc.edu). My research bridges formal linguistics and cognitive neuroscience, employing experimental methods, functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), and High-Definition transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (HD-tDCS) to investigate language and emotion processing in native and non-native speakers. I am co-advised by Drs. [Jiang Liu](https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/artsandsciences/dllc/our_people/liu_jiang.php) and [Rutvik Desai](https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/artsandsciences/psychology/our_people/directory/desai_rutvik.php). I am currently a Graduate Research Assistant in the [Aging Brain Cohort (ABC)](https://abc.sc.edu).

My dissertation investigates how native and non-native speakers perceive emotional cues through semantic and prosodic channels in Mandarin Chinese words and sentences. In this tonal language, the same acoustic feature (i.e., pitch) encodes both semantics and emotional prosody. To elucidate the neural underpinnings of these processes, I use fMRI to examine whether native speakers and second language learners engage similar cognitive mechanisms when processing semantics and emotional prosody in spoken language. This work is supported by NSF Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grant, University of South Carolina SPARC Graduate Research Grant, and Dr. Richard Walker Memorial Endowed Fellowship.
